## Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, you can submit a feature request. Before submitting a feature request, please check if a similar request already exists. If it does, you can add your comments and reactions to the existing request. Otherwise, you can open a new feature request issue and provide a detailed description of the feature you would like to see.

## Submitting Pull Requests

If you are a developer and want to contribute code to Iconsans, you can submit a pull request. Before starting any work, please check if there is an open issue related to your proposed change. If there isn't, you can open a new issue to discuss your proposed changes with the project maintainers.

To submit a pull request:

1. [Find an issue](https://github.com/mortezasabihi/iconsans/issues) that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under `your-GitHub-username/repository-name`.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`.
4. Use `yarn bootstrap` to install dependecies.
4. Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.
5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
6. Use `git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here` to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
7. Use `git commit` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to create a nice message.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin branch-name-here`.
9. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
10. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so `"Added more log outputting to resolve #4352"`.
11. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
12. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
13. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
14. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged! 🎉 🎉

Once your pull request is open, it will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may provide feedback or request further changes before merging your code.
